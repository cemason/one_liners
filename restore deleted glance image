If a Glance image is deleted for an instance, errors will arise when resizing, migrating, and possibly even just rebooting that instance. This shows how to restore the image if a backing file still exists on the instance's hypervisor. This requires updating the database so proceed at your own risk!

1. From infra node, get instance hypervisor name, image ID and name

# nova show <instance uuid> |egrep "hypervisor_hostname|image"

2. Database - check to make sure the image is really marked deleted

# use glance; select * from images where id='<image id>'\G

3. From the instance hypervisor, get disk info

# cd /var/lib/nova/instances/<instance uuid>/
# qemu-img info disk |grep "backing file"
# stat <backing file>

If it exists, great!

4. Database changes - remove the old image (so we can create one with the same ID). Careful here.

# use glance; SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0; UPDATE images SET id='xxx-<image id>' WHERE id='<image id>' LIMIT 1; SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;

5. From the instance hypervisor, upload to glance an image with the backing file as source and specify the original ID

# glance image-create --progress --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --name '<instance name> (restored)' --file <backing file> --is-public true --id <image id>

With this done resizes, migrations etc should be possible for those instances using the now-restored image.
