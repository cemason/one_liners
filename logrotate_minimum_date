# This was created in order to set a minimum log rotation interval, in this case 5 weeks (while leaving values which were already set higher as-is)
# It is escaped so that it can be used with tools such as dsh
# Note that this can also be run against /etc/logrotate.d/* for rotation settings there!

# perl -pi.bak -e 'if (m/rotate (\d+)/) {s/rotate \d+/rotate 5/ if (\$1 < 5);}' /etc/logrotate.conf
